<Section title="Why You Need to Know This" meta="ATTENTION">
  <p>
    A healthcare company builds an AI assistant powered by RAG to help doctors access patient records. The system works beautifully—until an attacker discovers that simply crafting queries like "recent diagnoses for all patients" returns documents across tenant boundaries. Thousands of HIPAA-protected records are exposed because embeddings weren't isolated per patient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector and embedding weaknesses are the #8 risk in OWASP's 2025 LLM rankings because RAG systems are now deployed in healthcare, finance, legal, and enterprise contexts—any weakness exposes highly sensitive data. Research shows that injecting just 5 malicious documents into a knowledge base can achieve 90% attack success in manipulating LLM outputs. Whether you're building enterprise search, document assistants, or knowledge-grounded chatbots, understanding how to secure your vector infrastructure is essential.

      Vulnerabilities in vector embeddings and RAG systems allow attackers to inject malicious content, manipulate retrieval results, access unauthorized data, or poison knowledge bases—compromising the entire application's integrity.
    </Quote>
    <p>
      RAG systems combine traditional database vulnerabilities with new semantic attack surfaces. Embeddings can be reverse-engineered to extract sensitive data, poisoned to manipulate outputs, or exploited for cross-tenant data leakage. Defense requires treating vector databases with the same rigor as SQL databases—plus semantic-aware access controls.
    </p>
  </div>
</TLDR>

<Section title="What Are Vector and Embedding Weaknesses?" meta="DEFINITION">
  <p>
    Modern LLM applications rely heavily on <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b>—fetching relevant documents from vector databases to provide context for the model's response. This architecture introduces a new attack surface: the embeddings themselves and the retrieval mechanism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Embeddings are high-dimensional numerical representations of text. A document like "Alice's medical record" becomes a vector like <code>[0.23, -0.45, 0.12, ...]</code>. When a user queries "Show me Alice's health history," the system finds embeddings with similar vectors and feeds those documents to the LLM.
  </p>
  <p>
    The vulnerabilities arise because: (1) embeddings can leak sensitive information through reconstruction attacks, (2) retrieval can be manipulated to return unauthorized data, and (3) adversarial documents can poison the vector space. Understanding the real-world impact of these weaknesses is critical for RAG system architects.
  </p>
  <Quote source="PoisonedRAG Research (USENIX Security 2025)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07867">
    Our results show that by injecting merely 5 malicious texts into a vast knowledge database of over 1 million texts, our attack achieves a 90% success rate in manipulating the LLM's output.

<Section title="Why It Matters" meta="IMPACT">
  <p>
    RAG systems are deployed in healthcare, finance, legal, and enterprise contexts—any weakness here exposes highly sensitive data.
  </p>
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Unauthorized Data Access.</b> <Link href="https://www.cobalt.io/blog/vector-and-embedding-weaknesses">Research shows</Link> that poor access controls in vector databases allow users to retrieve embeddings containing sensitive data they shouldn't access—bypassing traditional database permissions.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Cross-User Contamination.</b> In multi-tenant RAG systems, one user's query can inadvertently retrieve another user's documents if embeddings aren't properly isolated. Example: A healthcare chatbot leaking Patient A's records to Patient B.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Embedding Inversion Attacks.</b> Given an embedding vector, attackers can reconstruct partial or complete original text, especially for short documents. This allows extraction of sensitive information even if the raw text is access-controlled.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Data Poisoning via Malicious Documents.</b> <Link href="https://learn.snyk.io/lesson/llm-vector-and-embedding-weaknesses/">Snyk case study</Link> demonstrates how an attacker uploaded a fake financial article to a poorly moderated blog. When embedded, it mimicked legitimate sources and poisoned retrieval results—causing a chatbot to recommend worthless stocks.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Semantic Adversarial Attacks.</b> Craft documents that embed "close" to sensitive queries but contain malicious content. When users search for legitimate information, they receive poisoned results.
    </Item>
  </List>
  <p>
    To understand how these vulnerabilities are exploited, we first need to examine the three core components that make up every RAG system's attack surface.
  </p>
</Section>

<Section title="The Three RAG Attack Surfaces" meta="FUNDAMENTALS">
  <p>
    Every RAG system has three components that attackers can target, each requiring different security controls.
  </p>
  <Steps>
    <Step n={1}>
      <b>The Embedding Pipeline</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        The process of converting documents into vectors. Attackers can poison this pipeline by injecting malicious documents that embed close to high-value targets.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Attack surface:</i> Document upload, indexing process, embedding model selection.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Example vulnerability:</b> User-submitted documents are embedded without content validation, allowing poisoned content into the knowledge base.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={2}>
      <b>The Vector Database</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        The storage layer holding embeddings and their metadata. Attackers can exploit weak access controls to retrieve unauthorized data or manipulate metadata.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Attack surface:</i> Access control inheritance, tenant isolation, metadata integrity.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Example vulnerability:</b> Embeddings don't inherit source document permissions, allowing unauthorized retrieval.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={3}>
      <b>The Retrieval Mechanism</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        The query-to-document matching process. Attackers can craft adversarial queries designed to retrieve sensitive documents or bypass filters.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Attack surface:</i> Query filtering, similarity thresholds, result ranking.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Example vulnerability:</b> No query validation allows injection attacks that manipulate retrieval results.
      </p>
    </Step>
  </Steps>
  <p>
    With these attack surfaces in mind, let's examine the specific techniques attackers use to exploit them.
  </p>
</Section>

<Section title="Taxonomy of Attacks" meta="ATTACK VECTORS">
  <p>
    Attacks exploit both the mathematical properties of embeddings and the implementation flaws in RAG systems.

  <p className="text-sm text-neutral-400 mb-4">Injecting malicious content into the knowledge base.</p>
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Direct Embedding Injection.</b> If attackers have write access to the vector database (e.g., via a user-facing "upload document" feature), they can inject embeddings crafted to be retrieved for specific queries. Think SQL injection, but for semantic search.
      <br/><span className="text-xs text-neutral-500">Detection: Medium—content validation and provenance tracking help.</span>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Similarity Hijacking.</b> Create adversarial documents that embed near high-value targets. Example: Craft a fake product review that embeds close to "official documentation," causing the RAG system to retrieve the fake review instead.
      <br/><span className="text-xs text-neutral-500">Detection: Hard—adversarial documents appear legitimate in isolation.</span>
    </Item>

  <p className="text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-wider text-neutral-500 mt-6 mb-3">Data Extraction Attacks</p>
  <p className="text-sm text-neutral-400 mb-4">Recovering sensitive information from embeddings.</p>
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Embedding Inversion / Reconstruction.</b> Use gradient-based optimization or model inversion techniques to recover sensitive text from embedding vectors. Particularly effective for PII (names, emails, addresses) in short documents.
      <br/><span className="text-xs text-neutral-500">Detection: Very hard—attacks occur at inference time on exported vectors.</span>

      <br/><span className="text-xs text-neutral-500">Detection: Medium—query logging and access pattern analysis help.</span>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Metadata Manipulation.</b> Vector databases often store metadata alongside embeddings (author, timestamp, access level). Manipulating metadata can trick retrieval into returning unauthorized documents.
      <br/><span className="text-xs text-neutral-500">Detection: Medium—metadata integrity checks and audit logging.</span>
    </Item>

  <p className="text-sm text-neutral-400 mb-4">Non-negotiable controls for any production RAG system.</p>
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Access Control Inheritance.</b> Embeddings must inherit access controls from source documents. If "executive_report.pdf" is restricted to C-suite users, its embedding must carry the same permissions. Implement metadata-based filtering: before retrieval, check <code>embedding.acl</code> against <code>user.permissions</code>.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Multi-Tenant Isolation.</b> Use separate vector namespaces or collections per tenant. Never rely on filtering alone—physical separation prevents cross-contamination. Example: <code>tenant_123_embeddings</code> vs <code>tenant_456_embeddings</code>.
