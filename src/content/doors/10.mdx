      Unbounded consumption occurs when LLM applications allow excessive and uncontrolled inferences, leading to resource exhaustion, economic denial-of-wallet attacks, and service degradation for all users.

<Section title="What Is Model Denial of Service?" meta="DEFINITION">
  <p>
    Model Denial of Service (Model DoS) exploits the computational expense of LLM inference. Unlike traditional DDoS attacks that flood networks with junk packets, Model DoS uses <b>legitimate-looking prompts</b> that force the model into resource-intensive operations—massive output generation, infinite tool-call loops, or complex reasoning chains.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attack is particularly effective because LLM inference is inherently expensive: generating a single response can consume 10,000-100,000× more compute than serving a static webpage. An attacker needs only script dozens of "sponge" prompts to exhaust GPU capacity or burn through an API budget.
  </p>
  <Quote source="Mindgard Research (February 2025)" href="https://mindgard.ai/blog/deepseek-r1s-susceptibility-to-exhaustion-attacks">
    DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models are highly susceptible to exhaustion attacks. Simple prompts can trigger prolonged reasoning loops consuming excessive tokens. Timeout errors indicate resource exhaustion, not system failures—internal reasoning conflicts amplify vulnerability.
  </Quote>
</Section>

<Section title="Why It Matters" meta="IMPACT">
  <p>
    As LLMs power critical infrastructure (customer service, code generation, medical triage), availability becomes a security issue. Model DoS can disable services, inflate costs, or provide cover for other attacks.

      <b>Denial-of-Wallet (DoW): Formalized Threat.</b> <Link href="https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm102025-unbounded-consumption/">OWASP LLM10:2025</Link> now formally recognizes DoW as a primary attack vector where adversaries exploit consumption-based pricing to drain financial resources. If you pay per token, attackers can automate thousands of long-context requests to run up costs. <Link href="https://medium.com/enkrypt-ai/defending-against-sponge-attacks-in-genai-applications-bd7c8c6f0d5d">Sponge attack research</Link> shows malicious inputs increase energy consumption and latency by <b>10-200×</b>, with costs potentially escalating from $3/hour to $3,000/hour.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Service Degradation & Queue Saturation.</b> LLMs have limited concurrency (GPUs are expensive). One attacker monopolizing inference capacity means legitimate users face timeouts or degraded responses—denying service to paying customers while inflating operational costs.

      <b>Cascading Failures.</b> <Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.580.pdf">AutoDoS research (2025)</Link> demonstrates a single optimized prompt can increase latency <b>250×</b>, causing timeout cascades across dependent services (chatbots, RAG systems, agent workflows).

      <b>False Positive Exploitation: 97% Block Rate.</b> <Link href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02916">Research from 2024</Link> demonstrates attackers can exploit false positives in LLM safeguards to launch denial-of-service attacks. By inserting adversarial prompts as short as 30 characters, attackers trigger safety systems to mistakenly block legitimate content, achieving <b>97% rejection rates</b> on systems like Llama Guard 3. This turns security measures into attack vectors.

<Section title="Taxonomy of Attacks" meta="ATTACK VECTORS">
  <p>
    Attacks exploit various aspects of LLM resource consumption—inference time, token generation, tool use, and reasoning loops.
  </p>
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Sponge Attacks (Benign-Input DoS).</b> Prompts that appear harmless but trigger exponential resource use. Examples: "Explain the concept of infinity in 50,000 words" or "List all prime numbers." Unlike traditional DoS, these bypass content filters and rate limiters because they look legitimate.
      <br/><i>Defense Challenge:</i> Standard WAF rules don't detect semantic resource exhaustion.

      <b>AutoDoS (Automated Optimization).</b> <Link href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.580.pdf">ACL 2025 research</Link> introduced an algorithm that constructs DoS Attack Trees, automatically optimizing prompts for maximum resource consumption across black-box models. Uses "Length Trojan" embeddings to bypass defenses.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Poisoning-Based DoS (P-DoS).</b> <Link href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10760">Research (2024)</Link> demonstrates that injecting a single poisoned sample into fine-tuning data can cause models to generate 16,000-token repetitive outputs (vs. 500 tokens normally), permanently degrading the model.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Recursive Tool-Use Loops.</b> For agentic systems, prompts like "Keep searching until you find the answer" can trigger infinite tool-call chains (web search → summarize → search again → ...), consuming API quotas and compute.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Context Stuffing.</b> Uploading massive documents (PDFs, code repositories) to force the model to process millions of tokens per request. Combined with multi-turn conversations, this exhausts context windows.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Variable-Length Input Floods.</b> Sending numerous inputs of varying lengths to exploit inefficiencies in batching and resource allocation, causing queue congestion.

By inserting adversarial prompts as short as 30 characters into user requests, attackers caused Llama Guard 3 to mistakenly block over <b>97% of legitimate user requests</b>.

<Section title="Detection and Defense Strategies" meta="SECURITY CONTROLS">
  <p>
    Defense requires rate limiting, input validation, resource quotas, and anomaly detection.
  </p>
  <Steps>
    <Step n={1}>
      <b>Rate Limiting & Quotas (Per-User, Per-IP).</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        Implement tiered rate limits: X tokens/minute for free users, Y for paid. Track cumulative token usage over rolling windows. Set hard limits on context window size (e.g., max 100k tokens/request). Use exponential backoff for repeated long requests from the same source.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={2}>
      <b>Input Validation & Length Prediction.</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        <Link href="https://protectai.com/blog/detecting-resource-draining-prompts">ProtectAI research</Link> demonstrates training classifiers to predict output length from input prompts. Reject or throttle requests predicted to generate &gt;10k tokens. Enforce max input/output token budgets.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={3}>
      <b>Timeout & Circuit Breaker Patterns.</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        Set aggressive timeouts for inference (e.g., 30 seconds). If a request exceeds budget, terminate gracefully and return cached response or error. Implement circuit breakers: if timeout rate exceeds threshold, temporarily block the user/IP.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={4}>
      <b>Cost-Based Abuse Detection.</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        Monitor cost per request. If a single user's average cost exceeds 10× the median, flag for review. Detect patterns: repeated long outputs, tool-use loops, context stuffing. Auto-ban accounts exhibiting DoW behavior.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={5}>
      <b>Queue Priority & Resource Isolation.</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        Prioritize short, low-cost requests over long ones. Use separate GPU pools for free vs. paid tiers to prevent free-tier abuse from degrading premium service. Implement fair-share scheduling.
      </p>
    </Step>
    <Step n={6}>
      <b>Input Sanitization (Sponge Detection).</b>
      <p className="text-sm mt-2">
        Detect sponge patterns: excessive repetition requests ("repeat X 10,000 times"), unbounded generation ("write forever"), numerical exhaustion ("list all primes"). Block or rewrite these prompts.
      </p>
    </Step>
  </Steps>

<Section title="Key Takeaways" meta="SUMMARY">
  <List>
    <Item>
      <b>Model DoS is Economically Motivated.</b> Attackers exploit the 1000× cost multiplier of LLM inference vs. traditional web services. Denial-of-Wallet is as damaging as service downtime.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Sponge Attacks Bypass Traditional Defenses.</b> Benign-looking prompts that trigger 10-250× resource use evade WAFs and content filters. Defense requires semantic understanding and predictive models.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Reasoning Models Are More Vulnerable.</b> DeepSeek-R1 and similar systems with extended reasoning chains are easily trapped in exhaustion loops, requiring specialized circuit breakers.
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <b>Prevention is Multi-Layered.</b> No single defense suffices. Effective protection requires rate limiting, timeout enforcement, cost monitoring, input validation, and queue fairness—all working together.
